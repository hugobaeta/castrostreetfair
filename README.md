The Castro Street Fair is a community street celebration that was founded by Harvey Milk in 1974. Hundreds of local artists, vendors, craftspeople, and organizations line the streets and celebrate the diversity of the neighborhood. Stages with live entertainment and dance stages can be found throughout the fairgrounds.

The Fair is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization and all proceeds go directly to charitable causes important to the Castro community. Additionally, the Fair funds the rainbow flag that flies over the intersection of Castro and Market.

The 2016 Castro Street Fair is on Sunday, October 2, from 11am to 6pm.
The Fair is located in the heart of San Franciscoâ€™s Castro District, at the intersection of Market & Castro Streets and the surrounding area.
